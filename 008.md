# Deferred Liquidation can get stuck at step one of the liquidation process if the nonce increment

## Summary

Deferred Liquidation can get stuck at step one of the liquidation process if the nonce increments, leading to a loss of assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume the following:

1. At T10, PartyA becomes liquidatable due to price movement, resulting in a drop in PnL
2. At T20, PartyA is solvent again. This can be due to various reasons, such as users allocating more funds or the prices recovering. Note that in the new version of the protocol, allocating funds does not lead to an increase in the account's nonce.

> Per the [documentation](https://naveed1.notion.site/Symmio-changes-in-version-0-8-3-0dc891da26fc4706a59ba7295a26dfbd), the purpose of deferred liquidation is to allow the liquidator to liquidate the user who was liquidated at a certain block (it can be the current block or a block in the past). Even if PartyA is solvent in the current block, the account can still be liquidated if it has been eligible for liquidation in the past. The excess collateral in the accounts will returned back to the users.

3. Still at T20. A liquidator (Bob) is aware that PartyA is liquidatable at T10. Thus, he requests the deferred liquidation signature from Muon. At T10, PartyA's nonce is equal to 555. The `liquidationId`, `liquidationTimestamp`, `partyANonces` of the signature will be 100, T10, and 555, respectively. He proceeds to call the `deferredLiquidatePartyA` function with the signature, and the `liquidationId` of 100 is locked in the system. PartyA's liquidation status is set to true, and the account is technically "frozen".
4. At T21, one of the PartyBs that PartyA trades with triggers the `chargeFundingRate` function against the PartyA to charge a funding rate (non-malicious event), or it can also be executed intentionally with malicious intention. Note that one PartyA can trade with multiple PartyBs. The function will check if PartyA is solvent, and the [solvency check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-symmetrical-update-2/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/FundingRate/FundingRateFacetImpl.sol#L73) will pass because PartyA is solvent at this point (T21). At the [end of the function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-symmetrical-update-2/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/FundingRate/FundingRateFacetImpl.sol#L76), PartyA's nonce will increment to 556.

3. The liquidator's [deferredSetSymbolsPrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-symmetrical-update-2/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/DeferredLiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L62) transaction gets executed at T22. It is normal to have a slight delay due to many reasons, such as network congestion, low gas, or some preparation needed. Since the PartyA's nonce on the liquidation signature (555) is different from the current PartyA's nonce (556), the liquidation signature (liquidationId=100) will no longer be considered valid, and it cannot be used to proceed with the second step (set symbol price) of the liquidation process. The signature check is performed [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-symmetrical-update-2/blob/main/protocol-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/DeferredLiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L66).
4. If the liquidator attempts to fetch the liquidation signature for T10 from Muon again, PartyA's nonce of the signature will always remain at 555 because this is PartyA's nonce value at T10.
5. As a result, liquidation for PartyA will be struck.

## Impact

Loss of assets for the counterparty as the transfer of the assets from a liquidatable account to the counterparty cannot be made. The liquidation process cannot be completed as the liquidatable account is stuck.

In addition, since the liquidatable account is stuck, the assets under the accounts are also locked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

After step one of the deferred liquidation process, Party A's nonce should not change under any circumstance. Otherwise, the liquidation will be stuck.

Upon review of the codebase, it was found that only the `chargeFundingRate` function can update PartyA's nonce after step one of the deferred liquidation process. Thus, consider adding the `notLiquidatedPartyA` modifier to the `chargeFundingRate` function to prevent anyone from charging the funding rate against a PartyA account already marked as liquidated to mitigate this issue.

```diff
	function chargeFundingRate(
		address partyA,
		uint256[] memory quoteIds,
		int256[] memory rates,
		PairUpnlSig memory upnlSig
+	) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused notLiquidatedPartyA(partyA) {
-	) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused {
		FundingRateFacetImpl.chargeFundingRate(partyA, quoteIds, rates, upnlSig);
		emit ChargeFundingRate(msg.sender, partyA, quoteIds, rates);
	}
```
