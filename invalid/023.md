# Inconsistent Withdraw Event Emitted by `AccountFacet.internalTransfer:81`

## Summary

The `internalTransfer` function emits a `Withdraw` event with an inconsistent number of decimals compared to the `withdraw` and `withdrawTo` functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

Functions that directly emit events like `Deposit` and `Withdraw` in the system do so with amounts in the correct collateral decimals as specified by their documentation.

```solidity
// File: protocol-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol
   32: 	/// @param amount The precise amount of collateral to be withdrawn, specified in collateral decimals.
   33: 	function withdraw(uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused notSuspended(msg.sender) {
```

However, the `Withdraw` event is also emitted by the `internalTransfer` function, which according to its documentation, takes an amount parameter with 18 decimals, which is then passed directly to the `Withdraw` event.

```solidity
// File: protocol-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol
   78: 	/// @param amount The amount to transfer and allocate in 18 decimals.
   79: 	function internalTransfer(address user, uint256 amount) external whenNotInternalTransferPaused notPartyB userNotPartyB(user) notSuspended(msg.sender) notLiquidatedPartyA(user){
   80: 		AccountFacetImpl.internalTransfer(user, amount);
   81: 		emit InternalTransfer(msg.sender, user, AccountStorage.layout().allocatedBalances[user], amount);
   82: 		emit Withdraw(msg.sender, user, amount); // audit: should be in collateral decimals like original withdraw()
   83: 		emit AllocatePartyA(user, amount, AccountStorage.layout().allocatedBalances[user]);
   84: 		emit SharedEvents.BalanceChangePartyA(user, amount, SharedEvents.BalanceChangeType.ALLOCATE);
   85: 	}
```

## Impact

This inconsistency is problematic in a system that heavily relies on events (e.g.  for tracking new requests by external systems that fulfill intents). Solidity does not inherently provide a straightforward way to distinguish which function emitted an event, which can lead to incorrect assessments by external systems, resulting in erroneous business decisions  and lost of founds.

## Recommendation

Convert the amount to be consistent with the collateral's decimals and emit the event with a standardized format.
