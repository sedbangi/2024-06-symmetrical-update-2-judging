# Lack of Mechanism to Track `transactionId` in `BridgeFacet` Contract Prevents Bridges from Seamlessly Withdrawing Incoming Transfers

## Summary

The `transferToBridge()` function in the `BridgeFacet` contract is designed to transfer a specified amount to a designated bridge address. The bridges can then withdraw the received bridge value associated with a specific transaction ID using `withdrawReceivedBridgeValue`. However, since there is no mechanism in this contract to track the transaction ID of a RECEIVE transaction to a bridge, the withdrawal process becomes very complex.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability lies in the `BridgeFacet` contract. The `transferToBridge()` function, which processes the transfer, calls the `transferToBridge()` function from the `BridgeFacetImpl` library. While the `Layout` structure in the `BridgeStorage` library stores the transfer information, it is not publicly accessible because the `layout()` function within the library is marked as `internal` and there is no functions to view the layout data in `BridgeFacet` contract.

```solidity    
File: contracts/facets/Bridge/BridgeFacet.sol

    function transferToBridge(uint256 amount, address bridgeAddress) external whenNotAccountingPaused notSuspended(msg.sender) {
        BridgeFacetImpl.transferToBridge(msg.sender, amount, bridgeAddress);
        emit TransferToBridge(msg.sender, amount, bridgeAddress);
    }
```

```solidity
File: contracts/facets/Bridge/BridgeFacetImpl.sol

	function transferToBridge(address user, uint256 amount, address bridge) internal {
		GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
		BridgeStorage.Layout storage bridgeLayout = BridgeStorage.layout();

		require(bridgeLayout.bridges[bridge], "BridgeFacet: Invalid bridge");
		require(bridge != user, "BridgeFacet: Bridge and user can't be the same");

		uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) / (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
		require(AccountStorage.layout().balances[user] >= amountWith18Decimals, "BridgeFacet: Insufficient balance");
		
		uint256 currentId = ++bridgeLayout.lastId;
		BridgeTransaction memory bridgeTransaction = BridgeTransaction({
			id: currentId,
			amount: amount,
			user: user,
			bridge: bridge,
			timestamp: block.timestamp,
			status: BridgeTransactionStatus.RECEIVED
		});
		AccountStorage.layout().balances[user] -= amountWith18Decimals;
		bridgeLayout.bridgeTransactions[currentId] = bridgeTransaction;
	}
```
```solidity
File: contracts/storages/BridgeStorage.sol

	struct Layout {
		mapping(address => bool) bridges;
		mapping(uint256 => BridgeTransaction) bridgeTransactions;
		uint256 lastId;
		address invalidBridgedAmountsPool;
	}


	function layout() internal pure returns (Layout storage l) {
		bytes32 slot = BRIDGE_STORAGE_SLOT;
		assembly {
			l.slot := slot
		}
	}
```

Additionally, both the above functions and the contracts fail to implement a tracking mechanism to track or log the `transactionId`. This causes a situation where, without knowing the transaction ID associated with the bridge, the receiving bridge has to try out different transaction IDs in the `withdrawReceivedBridgeValue()` function to claim their receiving amount.

## Impact

Due to the lack of a tracking mechanism or log, the receiving bridge cannot identify their incoming transfers. This forces the receiving bridge to try random transaction IDs to claim their amount. As a result, most of the transactions will revert due to the use of incorrect transaction IDs associated with other bridges. The rate of reverts in `withdrawReceivedBridgeValues()` will be high without knowing the exact transaction IDs associated with that bridge.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a proper tracking mechanism to track `transactionId`s associated with any bridge, so that the bridge can fetch the incoming transaction IDs associated with them and withdraw the amount.

One method to use array to track induvidual bridges incoming transaction ids

Example:

```diff
struct Layout {
		mapping(address => bool) bridges;
		mapping(uint256 => BridgeTransaction) bridgeTransactions;
+               mapping(address => uint256[]) bridgesTransactionIds;
		uint256 lastId;
		address invalidBridgedAmountsPool;
	}
```
Push `transactionId` to this array while perform transfer and pop while performing withdraw.
