# `AccountFacet.internalTransfer:81` Allows Bypassing Accounting Pause and Allocating Funds

## Summary

The `internalTransfer` function lacks the `whenNotAccountingPaused` modifier and does not verify that the transferred funds are directed to an account different from the sender’s.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the documentation:
> This method allows a user to send their deposits to another user’s allocated balance. The receiver address cannot be a partyB and also should not be in a liquidated state.

However, the function does not check if `msg.sender` is different from the specified user. This oversight allows a user to transfer funds to themselves, thereby bypassing the `whenNotAccountingPaused` modifier, which might be blocking the `allocate` function at that moment.

```solidity
// File: protocol-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol
   79: 	function internalTransfer(address user, uint256 amount) external whenNotInternalTransferPaused notPartyB userNotPartyB(user) notSuspended(msg.sender) notLiquidatedPartyA(user){
```

## Impact

This is a critical issue in a system where such a bypass could lead to unregulated fund allocations, violating the intended accounting pause.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check to ensure that `msg.sender` is different from the specified user and apply the `whenNotAccountingPaused` modifier to the `internalTransfer` function to prevent bypassing the accounting pause.
