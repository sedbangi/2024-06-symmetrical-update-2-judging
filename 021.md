# `sendQuote` function may always revert

## Summary
The new `sendQuote` function will always revert as `PartyAFacetImpl.sol` checks on [PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L72](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/protocol-core/blob/develop/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L72) that is a valid affiliate. There is not task nor script that registers address(0) as a valid affiliate. Also creating a valid affiliate with address zero may lead to improper storage of collected fees. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `sendQuoteWithAffiliate` function is designed to handle fee distribution by specifying an affiliate address. However, the previous function `sendQuote` forces the affiliate address to be zero. Due to the check at L72 on `PartyAFacetImpl.sol`, the function reverts if the affiliate is not valid. Since address(0) cannot be a valid affiliate, this scenario causes the function to fail. Moreover, attempting to create a valid affiliate with address zero would result in improper fee storage, leading to fees being stores on the storage of the zero address.

## Impact
Lack of intended operation functionality and/or improper fee handling.

## Code Snippet
`sendQuote` calls `` with address(0) as affiliate.
[PartyAFacet.sol#L132](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/protocol-core/blob/develop/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacet.sol#L132)

## Recommendation
Consider removing this function. Or creating other workflow for address zero affiliates.
