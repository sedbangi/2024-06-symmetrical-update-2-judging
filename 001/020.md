# Inconsistent Handling of Decimal Precision in Bridge Transaction Restoration

## Summary
The `restoreBridgeTransaction` function in `BridgeFacetImpl.sol` fails to normalize amounts to the 18-decimal precision standard expected by `AccountStorage` during transaction restoration. This discrepancy arises because `BridgeStorage` stores amounts without decimal escalation, while `AccountStorage` assumes all balances are escalated. As a result, restoring a bridge transaction leads to incorrect balance updates in `AccountStorage`.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the restoration process, the [BridgeFacetImpl.sol#L90](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/protocol-core/blob/develop/contracts/facets/Bridge/BridgeFacetImpl.sol#L90) directly adds a non-escalated amount (`bridgeTransaction.amount - validAmount`) to an escalated balance in `AccountStorage`. This action violates the expected 18-decimal precision standard used throughout the system.

## Impact
The failure to normalize amounts during bridge transaction restoration results in inconsistent data in stored balances.  This impacts the accuracy of account balances within `AccountStorage`.

## Code Snippet
Non escalated amount storage on [restoreBridgeTransaction](https://github.com/SYMM-IO/protocol-core/blob/develop/contracts/facets/Bridge/BridgeFacetImpl.sol#L90-L92)
```solidity
function restoreBridgeTransaction(uint256 transactionId, uint256 validAmount) internal {
    ...
    
    AccountStorage.layout().balances[bridgeLayout.invalidBridgedAmountsPool] += (bridgeTransaction.amount - validAmount);
    bridgeTransaction.status = BridgeTransactionStatus.RECEIVED;
    bridgeTransaction.amount = validAmount;
}
```

```solidity
    BridgeTransaction memory bridgeTransaction = BridgeTransaction({
	    id: currentId,
	    amount: amount,
	    user: user,
	    bridge: bridge,
	    timestamp: block.timestamp,
	    status: BridgeTransactionStatus.RECEIVED
    });
    AccountStorage.layout().balances[user] -= amountWith18Decimals;
    bridgeLayout.bridgeTransactions[currentId] = bridgeTransaction;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Escalate `(bridgeTransaction.amount - validAmount)` before storing it in `AccountStorage` layout balances.
