# Lack of Handling for `validAmount` Greater Than `bridgeTransaction.amount` in `restoreBridgeTransaction` Function in `BridgeFacetImpl` Library

## Summary
The `suspendBridgeTransaction()` function in the `BridgeFacet` contract is designed to suspend a specific bridge transaction. A user with the `DISPUTE_ROLE` can restore the previously suspended bridge transaction and update the valid transaction amount through the `restoreBridgeTransaction` function by calling `restoreBridgeTransaction` from the `BridgeFacetImpl` library.

The issue is that the `restoreBridgeTransaction` function in the `BridgeFacetImpl` library does not handle situations where the supplied `validAmount` is greater than the previously set `bridgeTransaction.amount`.

According to the README of the audit:

> Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?
> 
> No

There is no limitation on the values that can be used in the `restoreBridgeTransaction` function. Therefore, this function is expected to accept an updated amount that is either less than or greater than the previously set amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `restoreBridgeTransaction` function in the `BridgeFacetImpl` library does not handle cases where `validAmount` is greater than `bridgeTransaction.amount`.

```solidity
	function restoreBridgeTransaction(uint256 transactionId, uint256 validAmount) internal {
		BridgeStorage.Layout storage bridgeLayout = BridgeStorage.layout();
		BridgeTransaction storage bridgeTransaction = bridgeLayout.bridgeTransactions[transactionId];

		require(bridgeTransaction.status == BridgeTransactionStatus.SUSPENDED, "BridgeFacet: Invalid status");
		require(bridgeLayout.invalidBridgedAmountsPool != address(0), "BridgeFacet: Zero address");

@>>		AccountStorage.layout().balances[bridgeLayout.invalidBridgedAmountsPool] += (bridgeTransaction.amount - validAmount);
		bridgeTransaction.status = BridgeTransactionStatus.RECEIVED;
		bridgeTransaction.amount = validAmount;
	}
```

This scenario results in a revert due to underflow caused by the operation `bridgeTransaction.amount - validAmount`. The function should allow `DISPUTE_ROLE` users to increase `bridgeTransaction.amount` by using a `validAmount` larger than `bridgeTransaction.amount`.

## Impact
The implementation restricts `DISPUTE_ROLE` users from increasing `bridgeTransaction.amount` by using a `validAmount` larger than `bridgeTransaction.amount`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the `restoreBridgeTransaction()` function to handle `validAmount`s greater than `bridgeTransaction.amount`, allowing `DISPUTE_ROLE` users to increase `bridgeTransaction.amount`.
